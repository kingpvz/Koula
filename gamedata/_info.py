HELP = """Welcome to KOULA!
(the best game ever for real)

Controls:
WASD/Arrow Keys - Move
Q - Previous Level
E - Skip Level
R - Restart Level

This is a quick tutorial to help you get started.
Every level consists of many small balls on the screen. And the goal is simple: Get the amount of points you need to win the level.
Every ball has a different purpose and acts differently too. If you wish to know what each ball does, use the Wiki!

Levels will always give you at least the amount of points you need. Basically try not to lose any. Simple as that!

EDITORHELP = """Welcome to the KOULA Level Editor!

Controls:
Left Click - Add or Replace ball
Right Click - Remove Ball

Keep in mind: There can only be one player ball (the first one). Adding another one causes it to simply change location.
Click on the balls in the ball selection menu (just under the map) to choose the ball you wish to add.
Movable balls have the speed parameter. Click on the number just above the text "SPEED" and type in any whole number (Minimum Speed: 1, Maximum Speed: 100).
If any problem occurs (input is not a number, speed is too large or too small), you'll get info in the text at the bottom of the editor upon trying to place a ball.
While the problem persists, you won't be able to place any balls.
