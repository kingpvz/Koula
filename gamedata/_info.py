VERSION = "beta3.1"

HELP = """Welcome to KOULA!
(the best game ever for real)

Controls:
WASD/Arrow Keys - Move
Q - Previous Level
E - Skip Level
R - Restart Level

This is a quick tutorial to help you get started.
Every level consists of many small balls on the screen. And the goal is simple: Get the amount of points you need to win the level.
Every ball has a different purpose and acts differently too. If you wish to know what each ball does, check the WIKI on the site you downloaded this from!
The wiki is located in the quick links section on top of the read me file.

Levels will always give you at least the amount of points you need. Basically try not to lose any. Simple as that!
