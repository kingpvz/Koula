HELP = """Welcome to KOULA!
(the best game ever for real)

This is a quick tutorial to help you get started.
Every level consists of many small balls on the screen. And the goal is simple: Get the amount of points you need to win the level.
Every ball has a different purpose and acts differently too.

Here is an overview:
YELLOW - Your player ball. You can move it around. Always spawns in the middle of the playarea.
BLUE (white outline) - Goal ball. Collect it to get 1 point.
BLACK (red outline) - Doom ball. Collect it to lose 1 point. Hopefully looks dangerous.

Levels will always give you at least the amount of points you need. Basically try not to lose any. Simple as that!
